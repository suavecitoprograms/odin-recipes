The Odin Project: Foundations - Project 1: Recipes
This repository will serve as a basic recipe website with the goal of showcasing my knowledge in the fundamentals of HTML and Git.
Ideally, it would reflect my understanding and prowess in the following:
    - HTML boilerplate
    - HTML text, list, links, and images
    - good Git commit messages
    - Git workflow
