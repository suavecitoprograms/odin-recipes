            <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                <br>
